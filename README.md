Steps to reproduce:
  1. Gmail account with 2 step verification
  2. Main phone number ends with 80.
  3. I noticed that "additional phone number was set to my previous one (which ends with 06).
  4. I updated "additional phone number" to my current one (80).
  5. I tried to log in on the completely new device (new to me)
  6. I enteted correct login, password, then I was asked for a code from my current phone number (ends with 80). Code comes correctly, I confirmed this code - it was correct..
  7. Next screen said "I dont recognize this device, so Im sending new code to my old phone number (06). This is actually a bug, it should be send to 06 because this numer has been already deleted - replaced with my current number (80).
  8. In the result I was unable to login because that was only way I could go.
  9. I entered third phone number as "additional phone number" and tried login again. At first I got code on my current phone number (80), then google said that they dont recognize this device and they sent a code to the third phone number that was added in the end.

Attack scenario:
This was serious problem because I couldn't get into my account. It could be super problematic when ability to quickly send email from new devices is needed. I couldn't log into my account and had to spend a lot of time to think how to fix bugged google login process.
